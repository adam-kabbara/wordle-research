FOUND is a legal second guess after TULIP in hard mode, but it isn’t the *only* legal guess. Per Scoredle, TULIP only narrows the field to 512.  

If you want Hard, find a path from TULIP to FOUND such that: 

-	every step is hard mode compliant 
-	according to Scoredle, FOUND is the *only* hard mode compliant alternative after the penultimate guess

"I don't play on hard mode by default but I normally follow the hard mode rules. That is until situations like these come up and I only have 3 guesses for 8 possibilities with only one letter missing! So it's basically risk/luck vs strategy. I know how my luck goes, so I chose strategy LOL. Also in hindsight I realize there were much better words I could have used for the 4th word but it happily worked out!
